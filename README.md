# MiniProject - Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

This repository provides the results for a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene. The project involves various tasks to analyze and interpret biological sequence data using a range of bioinformatics tools.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to perform an in-depth analysis of the TNF gene through multiple tasks, each focusing on different aspects of sequence analysis. Below are the specific tasks and their descriptions:

### Tasks

1. **Task 1: Download a Biological Sequence from NCBI and View/Edit It**
   - **Objective:** Download the TNF gene sequence from the NCBI database and view or edit the sequence data for further analysis.
   - **Tools Used:** NCBI Gene database, BioEdit (for viewing/editing)

2. **Task 2: Generate a Translation of a DNA or RNA Sequence into Amino Acids**
   - **Objective:** Translate the DNA or RNA sequence of the TNF gene into its corresponding amino acid sequence.
   - **Tools Used:** BioEdit

3. **Task 3: Find ORFs (Open Reading Frames) in a DNA or RNA Sequence**
   - **Objective:** Identify open reading frames (ORFs) within the TNF gene sequence to determine potential coding regions.
   - **Tools Used:** BioEdit

4. **Task 4: Analyze Sequence Composition (Nucleotide or Amino Acid Frequencies)**
   - **Objective:** Analyze the nucleotide or amino acid composition of the TNF gene sequence to understand its composition and properties.
   - **Tools Used:** BioEdit

5. **Task 5: Identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites Using the PROMO Tool**
   - **Objective:** Identify potential transcription factor binding sites within the TNF gene sequence using the PROMO tool.
   - **Tools Used:** PROMO

6. **Task 6: Search for Functional Motifs in a Genome or Transcriptome Using MEME**
   - **Objective:** Discover functional motifs in the TNF gene or associated transcriptome using the MEME Suite.
   - **Tools Used:** MEME Suite

7. **Task 7: Predict Coding/Non-Coding Regions in a Genome Using GENSCAN**
   - **Objective:** Predict coding and non-coding regions within the TNF gene sequence using GENSCAN.
   - **Tools Used:** GENSCAN

8. **Task 8: Convert Between Sequence File Formats Using BioEdit (FASTA to PHYLIP)**
   - **Objective:** Convert sequence files from FASTA format to PHYLIP format.
   - **Tools Used:** BioEdit
